# Basketball_2D_Mobile_Made_In_2_Days
A 2D Basketball Minigame, made with Unity for android phones.

The player needs to drag the ball in order to shoot it inside the hoop.
The round will start with a timer 30 seconds. The timer will decrease by 1 second until it reaches 0 seconds and the player loses the game.
Whenever the ball enters the hoop, score of 1 will be added to his score (+UI) and 10 seconds of time will be added to the current timer.
